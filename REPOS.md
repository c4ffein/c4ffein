## Contributions to other projects
*Projects I enjoyed contributing to*

#### [Parsec Cloud by Scille](https://github.com/Scille/parsec-cloud)
- A self-hostable cloud storage service with nearly full end-to-end encryption. See the [documentation](https://docs.parsec.cloud/en/latest/architecture.html).

#### [Djano Ninja](https://github.com/vitalik/django-ninja)
- Far more [KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) than [Django Rest Framework](https://github.com/encode/django-rest-framework), dropped [some small PRs](https://github.com/vitalik/django-ninja/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Ac4ffein), I really enjoyed working with that framework and pushed for its adoption at some companies.

## Small projects I only use myself

### Reusable code

- **[`1files-js`](https://github.com/c4ffein/1files-js)** Monorepo collection of short js libs I used, either developed by myself or just found and modified according to my needs
- **[`python-snippets`](https://github.com/c4ffein/python-snippets)** Python snippets that don't deserve to get released on PyPI

### Python cli utils
A collection of [KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) Python cli tools that each fit in one file.  
The coding standards differ from one project to another. Sometimes I didn't even setup a linter or any tests. Sometimes I vibe coded, then only checked the code for security. Overall really quick and dirty, I wanted to see if I could code a bunch of these tools on the fly and only enhance them when needed.

### Tools living on my servers
Decided I'd have more fun also vibe coding (still reviewing once before prod ofc) the tools that live on my servers.

### [presentations](https://github.com/c4ffein/presentations) - Archive for some slides

### [Custom Docker images](https://github.com/c4ffein/docker-images) - Custom setups I needed

## Just for fun

#### [shaders](https://github.com/c4ffein/shaders)
- Just some shaders

#### [xjsx](https://github.com/c4ffein/xjsx)
- A new way to generate React elements without jsx, inspired by pug syntax, compatible with Tailwind CSS, actually pure JavaScript - I had fun writing this, but feeling that I need to precise that you probably shouldn't use this
